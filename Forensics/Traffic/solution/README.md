# Traffic - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Traffic
Points: 50
Category: Forensics

## Objective
The objective of the Traffic challenge is to analyze network traffic data to uncover a suspicious or malicious website visited by a user. Your task is to set up the necessary tools and process the data to identify the sketchy website and discover the hidden flag.

## Solution
To successfully complete the Traffic challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Use Rita and Zeek**:
   - The challenge hints at the use of Rita and Zeek, which are network traffic analysis tools. These tools are essential for this challenge.

2. **Setting Up Rita and Zeek**:
   - Note that setting up Zeek and Rita can be more challenging than solving the actual challenge. Ensure that you have these tools correctly configured and running.

3. **Import Data into Rita**:
   - Once Rita is installed and configured, you need to import the network traffic data into its database. You can do this using a command like:
     ```
     rita import ur_directory/* name_of_database
     ```

4. **View HTML Report**:
   - After importing the data, it's useful to generate an HTML report for analysis. You can create an HTML report for the database using the following command:
     ```
     rita html-report name_of_database
     ```

5. **Analyze Websites Visited**:
   - In the HTML report, explore the list of websites that the user visited. Look for any suspicious or sketchy sites that might lead you to the flag.

6. **Using Grep (Optional)**:
   - Alternatively, you can use the `grep` command to search through the data and find the sketchy website that reveals the flag.

7. By following these steps, you will discover the hidden flag within the network traffic data.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `flag{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Utilize Rita and Zeek to analyze the network traffic data and identify the sketchy website that contains the flag in the Traffic challenge. Good luck!
