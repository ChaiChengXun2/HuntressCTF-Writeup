# RAT - CTF Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Name**: RAT
- **Points**: 50
- **Category**: Malware

## Objective
The objective of the "RAT" (Remote Access Trojan) CTF challenge is to uncover the hidden flag within a suspicious executable. The challenge emphasizes various approaches to analysis, including static and dynamic methods, and ultimately reveals the flag through a clever twist.

## Solution
As I embarked on the journey to solve this challenge, I explored various avenues but encountered unique challenges along the way.

1. **Static Analysis with IDA**: My initial approach was to perform static analysis using the IDA disassembler. However, I soon realized that the challenge executable required features from the IDA Pro version, which I did not have access to. Consequently, I was unable to proceed with this method.

2. **Dynamic Analysis with ProcMon**: I decided to switch to dynamic analysis using Process Monitor (ProcMon). During this analysis, I observed that the executable established network connections. This indicated the potential presence of network communication.

3. **Network Monitoring with TCPView and Wireshark**: To investigate the network connections further, I employed tools like TCPView and Wireshark. These tools allowed me to capture and analyze the network packets. However, this approach did not yield the desired results, and I found myself facing another roadblock.

4. **Leveraging VirusTotal**: At this point, I was left with limited options. To my surprise, I decided to submit the executable to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/). Much to my delight, VirusTotal not only scanned the file but also revealed the flag in plaintext.

In a clever twist, the challenge's solution was hidden in plain sight, underscoring the importance of exploring multiple analysis methods. VirusTotal, in this case, acted as the unexpected key to unlock the flag.

## Flag
The flag is in the format `flag{XXXXXXXXXX}`. After submitting the executable to VirusTotal, you will discover the flag conveniently revealed in plaintext.
