### Description

Oh wow, a malware analyst shared a sample that I read about in the news!

But it looks like they put it in some weird kind of archive...? Anyway, the password should be infected as usual!

NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.
