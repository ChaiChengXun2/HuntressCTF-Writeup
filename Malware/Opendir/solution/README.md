2. **Download All Files:**
   - Instead of manually browsing through each file within the directory, it's more efficient to download all the files from the website. You can do this using the following command:

      ```
      wget -r <url>
      ```

   - This command recursively downloads all files and directories from the website, preserving the directory structure.

3. **Search for the Flag:**
   - Once you have downloaded all the files, you can use the `grep` command to search for the flag within the files. Execute the following command in the directory where you downloaded the files:
      ```
      grep -r -i "flag{"
      ```
   - This command recursively searches for the flag pattern ("flag{") in all files, including subdirectories.

4. **Flag Discovery:**
   - By executing the `grep` command, you will uncover the hidden flag within one of the files, and it will be displayed as the search result.
