## Challenge: HumanTwo

- **Title:** HumanTwo
- **Points:** 50
- **Category:** Malware
- **Author:** @JohnHammond

### Description

During the MOVEit Transfer exploitation, there were tons of "indicators of compromise" hashes available for the `human2.aspx` webshell! We collected a lot of them, but they all look very similar... except for very minor differences. Can you find an oddity?

**NOTE:** This challenge is based on a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of an abundance of caution, it is strongly encouraged that you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.
