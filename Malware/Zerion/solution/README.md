**Points:** 50
**Category:** Malware

## Objective

The objective of the Zerion challenge was to uncover the flag hidden within a given piece of encoded text.

## Solution

1. **Initial Approach**
   - At the outset, I suspected that decoding the equation found within the file might reveal the flag.

2. **Discovering the Missing File**
   - However, I soon realized that the challenge required a specific file that was not provided.

3. **Pivoting to a New Strategy**
   - With the knowledge that I lacked a required file, I had to pivot to an alternative approach.

4. **Leveraging CyberChef**
   - I focused my attention on the encoded text found below the equation. I copied this seemingly random text and pasted it into CyberChef's "Magic" tool to experiment with different decoding methods.

5. **Initial Attempt**
   - My initial attempt to decode the text using the "Magic" tool in CyberChef didn't yield any results. The text remained undeciphered.

6. **Identifying the Anomaly**
   - Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the text had "==" in front of it, which is indicative of base64 encoding. However, my initial attempt to decode it had been unsuccessful.

7. **Reverse Decoding**
   - I decided to reverse the entire encoded text and tried decoding it once more using CyberChef's "Magic" tool. This time, I achieved success.

8. **Decoding Configuration**
   - It became apparent that the text was encoded using a variation of the base64 encoding. This configuration differed from the standard base64 encoding.

9. **Flag Extraction**
   - With the correct decoding configuration in place, I successfully decoded the encoded text, revealing the flag for this challenge.

10. **Flag**
    - The flag for the Zerion challenge is `flag{XXXXXXXXXX}`. I replaced 'XXXXXXXXXX' with the actual flag I obtained after successfully decoding the encoded text.

This challenge demonstrated the need to be adaptable and persistent in my problem-solving approach, ultimately leading to the discovery of the hidden flag.
