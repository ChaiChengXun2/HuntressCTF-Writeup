## Solution

To successfully complete the "Snake Eater" malware challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Use Windows for Analysis:**
   - To effectively analyze this challenge, it's highly recommended to use a Windows operating system. This is because the provided file is a Windows executable and may not run properly on other platforms.
