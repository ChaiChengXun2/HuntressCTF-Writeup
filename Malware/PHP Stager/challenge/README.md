## Challenge: PHP Stager

- **Title:** PHP Stager
- **Points:** 50
- **Category:** Malware
- **Author:** @JohnHammond

### Description
Ugh, we found PHP set up as an autorun to stage some other weird shady stuff. Can you unravel the payload?

NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.
