# Huntress CTF 2023 Writeups

Welcome to my Huntress CTF 2023 writeups! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to be a part of the Huntress CTF 2023, celebrating Cybersecurity Awareness Month and diving into the world of Capture The Flag challenges. I'm ready to take on these daily challenges, learn new skills, and document my journey right here.

## My Approach

As a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, I approach the Huntress CTF with the following goals:

- **Learn:** Every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, whether it's a new technique, tool, or concept.
- **Collaborate:** I enjoy collaborating with fellow participants to share insights and knowledge, making the journey more enriching.
- **Document:** I'll be writing detailed writeups for the challenges I solve, helping others and reinforcing my own understanding.

## Writeups

As I progress through the Huntress CTF 2023, I'll be documenting my solutions and insights for the challenges I tackle. You can find my writeups in the respective directories, organized by category. Feel free to explore them, learn from them, and provide feedback.

## Writeups

I want to give a huge shoutout to Huntress Labs, John Hammond, and everyone who made the Huntress CTF 2023 an unforgettable experience of learning and bonding. ðŸ™Œ
