## Solution Steps

2. **Identify Distorted Backgrounds:**
   - One way to distinguish AI-generated images is to look for distorted or unusual backgrounds.
   - AI-generated images may exhibit background distortions or inconsistencies that are less common in photographs of real people.
   - If you notice any image with a background that looks unnatural or out of place, it's likely generated by an AI.

3. **Note Facial Features:**
   - Observe the facial features of the people in the images.
   - AI-generated images might produce individuals with facial features that appear overly idealized, beautiful, or flawless.
   - Remember that this assessment is not a form of discrimination but an identification technique.

4. **Determine AI-Generated Images:**
   - Go through each image and make a note of which ones you believe are generated by AI based on the characteristics mentioned.
   - Keep in mind that the challenge focuses on recognizing AI-generated images rather than making value judgments about the appearance of individuals.
