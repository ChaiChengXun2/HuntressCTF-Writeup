### Description

While walking home through a dark alley you find an archaic 1980s cassette tape. It has "PRESS PLAY ON TAPE" written on the label. You take it home and play it on your old tape deck. It sounds awful. The noise made you throw your headphones to the floor immedately. You snagged a recording of it for analysis.

WARNING: The audio in this file is very loud and obnoxious. Please turn your volume way down before playing.
